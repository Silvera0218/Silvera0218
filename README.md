### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Silvera!

I am a Master's student in Mathematics at the University of Macau, specializing in **Elliptic Equations (PDEs)**, specifically focusing on problems of the **De Giorgi type**. My path to mathematics was interdisciplinary; **before my undergraduate studies in math**, I studied **Food Science, Biology, and Bioinformatics**.

Beyond my core research, I am an enthusiast of **Fluid Dynamics, Differential Geometry, and General Relativity**. My main passion is bridging the gap between complex mathematical theory and real-time, interactive visualization.

-  Iâ€™m currently building physically-accurate simulations of astrophysical phenomena.
-  Iâ€™m self-learning **GLSL** and **ModernGL** to trace light through curved spacetime.

      <p>
        A real-time simulation of both Schwarzschild (static) and Kerr (rotating) black holes. It accurately demonstrates key General Relativity phenomena by performing numerical integration (4th-Order Runge-Kutta) on the GPU:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Gravitational Lensing</b>: Distorts the background starfield.</li>
        <li><b>Frame-Dragging</b>: The "spacetime vortex" effect of the rotating Kerr hole.</li>
        <li><b>Relativistic Doppler Beaming</b>: The bright approaching vs. dim receding disk.</li>
        <li><b>The Photon Ring</b>: Delicate, nested rings of light at the shadow's edge.</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <p>
        A real-time traversable wormhole (Morris-Thorne metric) simulator. It performs "reverse ray-tracing" in a GLSL fragment shader for every pixel to accurately simulate the exotic visual distortions of passing through a wormhole.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Physically-Accurate</b>: Based on the analytic model from arXiv:1502.03809.</li>
        <li><b>First-Person Traversal</b>: Full 6-DOF (six-degrees-of-freedom) camera control.</li>
        <li><b>Connects Two Universes</b>: Links two distinct "universes" (skyboxes).</li>
        <li><b>Multiple Images</b>: Renders the multiple "ghost images" visible inside the throat.</li>
